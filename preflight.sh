#
# Run this once when you start, and again in any board you clone. It checks the
# things that have nothing to do with mathematics but stop you anyway: missing
# tools, too little disk, a checkout without the history a board needs, a key
# that does not work. Every failure says what to do about it.
#
#   ./preflight.sh                 platform checks; board checks too if run
#                                  inside a board checkout
#   ./preflight.sh <task-id|url>   also confirm you can read that task
#
# Board checks are driven entirely by the board's own task.json, so this script
# is not specific to any one problem.
#
# It reads; it changes nothing. You are encouraged to read it before running it —
# the same principle as the checkers, which we ask you to build yourself rather
# than trust. Please do not pipe it from the network into a shell.
