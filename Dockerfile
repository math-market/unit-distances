# Sandbox image for this problem's checker.
#
# Deliberately minimal: the whole point is that a solver can read this file in
# ten seconds and know exactly what will run. Add nothing that is not needed to
# execute check.py.
#
# You build this image yourself from the repository you just cloned, so the
# checker inside it is the checker you read — nothing is downloaded from us.
# To confirm rather than trust:
#
#   docker run --rm --entrypoint cat checker /task/check.py | diff - check.py
#
# The base image is pinned by digest, not by tag: a tag like `python:3.12-slim`
# moves over time, so without this two people building the same commit could get
# different environments and a settled result might not reproduce.
